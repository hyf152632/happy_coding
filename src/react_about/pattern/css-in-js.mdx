# css in js

## [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/install)

### @emotion/core

`css` prop support:

- Similar to the `style` prop, but also has support for auto vendor-prefixing, nested selectors, and media queries.
- Allows developers to skip the `styled` API abstraction and style components and elements directly.
- The `css` prop also accepts a function that is called with your theme as an argument allowing developers easy access to common and customizable values.
- Reduces boilerplate when composing components and styled with emotion.

The `@emotion/styled` package is for those who prefer to use the `styled.div` style API for creating components.

### install

There are lots of ways to use Emotion, if you’re using React, the easiest way to get started is to use the `@emotion/core` package. If you’re not using React, you should use the `emotion` package.

## [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/home)

[Getting Started with Gatsby](https://theme-ui.com/getting-started/gatsby/)

`inlineCode (MDX-specific key for <code> that is not a child of <pre>`

`thematicBreak (MDX-specific key for <hr>)`

You can think of the style object that the `sx` prop accepts as a superset of CSS.

```js
// example theme colors
{
  colors: {
    text: '#000',
    background: '#fff',
    primary: '#07c',
    modes: {
      dark: {
        text: '#fff',
        background: '#000',
        primary: '#0cf',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

setting the color mode:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useColorMode } from 'theme-ui';
export default (props) => {
  const [colorMode, setColorMode] = useColorMode();
  return (
    <header>
      <button
        onClick={(e) => {
          setColorMode(colorMode === 'default' ? 'dark' : 'default');
        }}
      >
        Toggle {colorMode === 'default' ? 'Dark' : 'Light'}
      </button>
    </header>
  );
};
```
